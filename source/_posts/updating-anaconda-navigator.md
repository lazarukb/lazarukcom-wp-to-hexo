For whatever reason my installations of Anaconda Navigator always refuse to update through the GUI. No matter how many times I click the Yes to upgrade, nothing happens.

So finally I found 15 seconds where I was both tired of this situation and had the clarity of thought to do something about it.

```
conda deactivate
conda update anaconda-navigator
```

Problem solved. Sigh.
