#### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Brad Lazaruk collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Brad Lazaruk's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Brad Lazaruk's visitors use its website. From time to time, Brad Lazaruk may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Brad Lazaruk also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on lazaruk.com blogs/sites. Brad Lazaruk only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

In each case, Brad Lazaruk collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Brad Lazaruk. Brad Lazaruk does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
