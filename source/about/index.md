Hi. I am most recently a technical solutions manager, based in Calgary, Alberta and working with clients throughout Canada. I have extensive experience with helping customers identify technology and business requirements as well as leading cross-functional teams of engineers and architects in designing innovative solutions at minimal cost. My work has included private sector and public sector organizations.

I hold a valid Canadian Level II Secret security clearance.

I am a member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) and [CIPS (Canada's Association of I.T. Professionals)](https://cips.ca/).

I have delivered midrange and Intel based solutions for successful proposals for both new business and early renewal revenue.

Through other positions I've held I have also:  
\- worked directly with customer management and executives to schedule outages and resolve major incidents  
\- driven continual improvements through updating processes and documentation and ensuring team compliance  
\- developed a culture of change and inclusion by encouraging team communication and participation in cross-training

I am currently working to acquire a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am on schedule to complete this program in 2024. As part of this work I am available to take on roles in software engineering and academic computer science, including tutoring.
